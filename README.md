# Hello-World
My first repository
Hi everyone, 
Mike here. I want to learn to programme. I know C++ and I want to learn Java.
I like to spend Saturday in my country garden taking care of the vegetables and fruits trees. I like to eat BIO vegetables and fruits grown by myself.
Now, on 07.05.2019 I make the second commitment in this branch
